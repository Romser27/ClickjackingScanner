# Clickjacking Scanner

With this script you can determine if there is a clickjacking vulnerability. The script checks websites for the "X-Frame-Options" HTTP response header. Enter the websites you want to search inside the domains.txt file. For this script to work, clickjacking_scanner.py and domains.txt files must be in the same folder. And run it with Python 3.
